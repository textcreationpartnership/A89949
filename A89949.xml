            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It frights you as if you was ſerved with a Warrant for <hi>Jamaica</hi> or <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> Come, come, lets paſſe off the thoughts of it, for it makes you look as if you had the Yellows, or black-Jaundies: Hang't, it will cauſe you to fall into a Conſumption, and to end your dayes as <hi>Judas,</hi> in diſpair and a halter; for my part, I love no ſuch Purgation, though I confeſſe there's many have tauen a turn and one ſlip out of the world, for leſſe Villainies then we are guilty of, for we rob more in our chambers then they do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high-way: Lawyers and their Clarks are as danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for mens purſes as Dr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Clarks; our Pens are as bad as their Piſtols; for they make men onely to ſtand, but we make them to fall: A Hare has not more Muſes then we have ſleights, traverſes, compaſſings, windings, turnings, wheelings, falſifyings, broyls and turmoyls in our Game at Law: <hi>Will.</hi> the Conqueror was our good Founder, and all the Rings have been ſpecial Benefactors to our cunning Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and who knows but that the Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, and all the old Prieſts followed our Courts with conſtant fee, and were excellently verſed in our Muſe; nay, the poor Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of 10 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> would ſue at Law for tithe Eggs, or Geeſe, or for two penny offerings: At Eaſter Weſtminſter-Hall and all our Inns ſwarmed with that Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> but ſince the Reformation they are poor, and now are quiet by force: Curſt Gows have ſhort horns; the Preſbyters teeth water to be in our Court, but that they dare not for fear of ſcandal or ejection: Wel, for my part if all agree to it ſince

               <p>Handſomly and dextrouſly pleaded Brother <hi>Hold-Caſe,</hi> thou mayeſt, if the Chancery-court continues in its highneſſe, come to be one of the Maſters, for thou haſt thoſe qualities that advances men of that Robe of <hi>subtilty, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> and <hi>Confidence;</hi> and now pray hear what I think of thoſe that are commonly called <hi>REFERREES,</hi> I do not ſay but that the men are noble, and honeſt, and fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for honeſt Imployments, and act according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and a good conſcience; but whats that to us, or what need we be afraid of their Court? for I tell you merry blades, that alas they take but our leavings, and meddle on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with poor Petitioners which we have long ago had the pulling of, and becauſe they had no more feathers, were not worth our conſideration, and ſo were either hung up as dead flies, and fowls in our Courts, or elſe they meddle with ſuch caſes and perſons whoſe Creditors have arreſted and laid up in a Counter, or ſome other of the Devils Purlews, for moneys which they (being in Law) borrowed to feed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117934:5"/>
us withal, and they being ſpent, what care we what becomes of them; for he or they that come amongſt us when all their Angels are flown, may do as thoſe who come to ſee a Play without money, they might ſtand without to be laught at, but ſhould not come in to hear or ſee how the game is plaid: I tell you the truth, I went one day to be a Spectator and a hearer at White-Hall, and at firſt entrance I ſpyed two or three of old Mr. Squeeze-Purſes Clyents, and three or four of Sergeant Horſe-Leaches decayed followers, who looked as though they had been Priſon-powder'd, and were as you know, in ſuch a Term outſworn by two or three of the old Velvet-Doublet-Knights of the Poſt, becauſe they wanted moneys to fee and to feed the two cormorants any longer; their Petitions were not (as they might and ſhould indeed have been) made againſt the Lawyers, but againſt their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe Creditors, and ſo they had their freedome from impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, paying ſome little pittance from out of their week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labor to their creditors; for we pull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d and eat the two Geeſe, and the creditors got a Feather; ſome of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſaid that they had been 10. 12. yeers in the Chancery, and I know not how long before at the Common Law. And at thoſe words I thought and doubted I ſhould have heard ſome of Comittee cenſure, the proceedings of our Courts, but they did not ſpeak any thing to that, but bad the poor ſneaks be diligent in Labour, and careful to pay their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as God ſhould inable; and added in the end, Come no more into Law, nor meddle not with Lawyers, &amp;c. and ſo diſmiſt them; and what hurt is all this to us? I add one thing more to comfort us; Alas good ſouls! they do ſit, 'tis true, and are judicious perſons; but they have no power to binde or looſe, or to determine a cauſe, or force any to ſtand to their Orders or Determinations; perſwade they may, but not command obedience to their Decrees; and it is a doubt whether all that they have done be availing and binding; or whether they ſit now in Parliament time; there is a buzzing and flying rumor, but 'tis no more that they ſhall be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and have power to act by Authority of Parliament; it may be ſo; what then? I'le declare to you my judgement (ſly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117934:6"/>
ſlaves) in this particular, not to diſparage our ſelves, but to our comfort, Are there any hopes that ſuch a conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Court of Equity and Charity ſhould be now erected and eſtabliſhed <hi>de Novo?</hi> Who will plead for it? or petition to any purpoſe to obtain it? Firſt, not the Commiſſioners themſelves; for 'tis a toil and trouble to them and ſpends their Spirits, their time and their moneys too, for they have but their labor for their pain and hard language, and deep cenſures by too many of the Creditors for their good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; their place is impoſed upon them, they never ſought it; and what hopes are there I ſay, that ſuch a noble, juſt, and upright a Court as this is ſhould continue long, there being no Fees or means of Maintenance, and the men themſelves are ſo generous and Chriſtianly ſpirited, that they ſcorn (that which our Tribe moſt love) fat and frequent bribes, and dayly Fees.</p>
               <p>And further I ſay, if a company of poor, deſparate and forlorne Priſoners and Debtors ſhould come and hang about the Parliament for the ſettlement of ſuch a Court, is it not firſt extrajudicial? May it not ſeem to tend to innovation in the State, to introduce and eſtabliſh a new Law? to be ſure the Petitioners will be (being poor) ſonndly checkt; for have not our Maſters and Lords a great voice in the Houſe? and do you think that ever ſuch a Petition will be granted as long as they ſit there? it being ſo contrary to our practice and profit, and tending to the almoſt ſubverſion? however to be a check and curb to all our Inns of Court, and ſo not likely to paſs current.</p>
               <p>But to put the queſtion one ſtop further, if it ſhould, which I never fear it will, yet I warrant you our Grandees will have the ordering of it, and the Committee of REFERREES muſt be referr'd to them to State and Model; and they'l be ſure to put in Objections enough againſt it, to demur to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it; and when tis done it ſhall not want cautions, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes, and reſtrants, as I could name ſome.</p>

               <p>Admirably well pleaded arguing a ſublime and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſpirit for advance of the Law; and I tell you, I could wiſh thy ſpeech were preſented to ſome chief Officers; and I hold it ſitting, if we intend our own good, to petition ſome of our Grandees to endeavor to ſtop ſuch petition if it ſhould come in; for though I am glad to hear what is ſpoken on our behalf; yet I aſſure I doubt it much that ſuch a thing may be effected, which I do for theſe reaſons following:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We all know that we are hated of all men, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe; as for our fees, and bribes, and deferring, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murring in mens cauſes, and ſuffering, and procuring their Ruine, and we are curſt as Foxes for woorying Lambs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are generally envied for our wealth; and many of us, if not moſt of us, are ſuſpected not to favour this preſent thing call'd Government, our affections are of another bent:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117934:7"/>
and then many of us have been of thoſe creatures that are called Delinquents and Mags, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the world knows we are ſetled on the Lees, and deſerve a purgation. I know ſome great ones that fear night and day, and expect a change, and think they have ſeen their beſt dayes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Court of REFERREES is known ſo much already and applauded, they are judicious godly men, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reputed ſuch as are men of courage, fearing God, and hating covetouſneſſe, and ſo unreprovable; they covet not (as we do too much) any mans ſilver or gold: And then they are men that have ſwords by their ſides, and great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters and then they do all (which we never did care to do) for conſcience and charity; and then (I ſpeak it with grief) tis a more honorable, neceſſary, and a juſter courſe &amp; Court then ever we intended to hare ſet up: What think you theſe my maſters ſpeak truth (which we ſeldom do) May it not be ſet up think you?</p>

for Grievances; and if they ſhould be ſtrict to relieve Petitioners, I doubt many of our Tribe will be fetch'd in to anſwer for our former iniquities; however they will eaſe us of many Clyents; for ſure men will leave our Courts where they have been ſo hurried and wooryed, and apply themſelves there where they are ſure to finde men of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to determine their buſineſſe without Fees or under feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; what think you of this news? I doubt a poor <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Term: I proteſt it puts me to ſuch ſhrugs, that I am as afraid to be brought in to their Court, as a Spaniard does to ſee an Engliſh Frigot: And truly I have been ſo much uſed to the Art of drawing, draining and purloining mens Pockets, that I had rather ſteal then beg; and work is counted ſo poor and baſe, that I had rather hang then labour: and for to be a Soldier and fight for 5. s. alas!

we have other moſt intricate and exquiſite coops and cages to keep yong Suitors faſt in alſo: Ah! 'twas a fine time for our trade when Court-hand writing, and bald curtald Latine Writs were all in faſhion; whenas no Vicar, or Parſon, or Curate could expound it, but the Under-Sheriff, or ſome old Attorney in a whole county could tell what to make of our Writs and Warrants; the countrey people would ſtare at a <hi>Subpaena,</hi> at if it had been a ſpel made by an old conjurer; and when it was politickly and powerfully pronounced and ſerved, would ſo ſtartle the poor Farmers, that their gaſtly looks when they come home would frighten their wives, and ſo ſcare their very cows, that they would be horn mad to ſee their Maſter look as if he were run out of his wits; he comes home ſo maſked, that he fetches his poor cattel and horſes ſtraw for hay, and chaff for corn.</p>
